# Tic Tac Toe Game (React + Vite)

This project provides a minimal setup to build a Tic Tac Toe game using React in Vite with HMR and ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features

- Simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board
- Move history tracking
- Game status updates (Next player / Winner)
- Built with React functional components and hooks
- Lightning-fast development using Vite
